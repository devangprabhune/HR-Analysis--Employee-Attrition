# 🧠 Employee Attrition Analysis

A complete data science project aimed at analyzing employee attrition using machine learning and SHAP explainability techniques. This analysis identifies key factors contributing to attrition and offers actionable business recommendations based on model interpretation.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores an HR dataset to understand why employees leave the organization. Through data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and interpretability analysis, we uncover key drivers of attrition and provide insights that can inform HR policies.

---

## 📁 Dataset

**File:** `HR_Analytics.csv`  
The dataset contains 35 features and 1470 employee records, including variables such as:

- Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status  
- Job Information: Department, Job Role, Job Level  
- Compensation: Monthly Income, Stock Option Level  
- Work-Life: OverTime, Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction  
- Outcome: Attrition (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, SMOTE)
- SHAP (Model Explainability)
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook Environment)

## 📈 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Handling Imbalanced Classes with SMOTE**
4. **Model Training using Random Forest**
5. **Model Evaluation (Accuracy, ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix)**
6. **SHAP Analysis for Model Interpretability**
7. **Business Recommendations**
